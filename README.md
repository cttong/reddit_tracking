# To Do's


## Major Priorities:
-PRIORITY: Data scraper

	-Change filter size to >, 1 rather than > 5
	
-Scrape comments alt-right/nazi websites to use as a baseline

-Come up with a list of other subreddits to look at

	-Get r/liberal and r/conservative
	
	-Get other extreme subreddits, accounting for identity, candidates, etc. 
	
-Setup a script which compares by author/subreddit over time to r/thealtright and calculate some distance

	-When comparing posts language - look at author level, not post level
	
-Compare the language between these subreddits. Is the left and right that different? If they are similar - maybe this indicates something.

## Minor Priorities 
-Check the rank graph either by using (1) frequency of users and (2) frequency/rank of post count

-Seperating out comments vs. posts and check if there are differences between them

-Cut the data into 4 quartiles by the amount of posts they make and see if there are differences
-Maybe look at the founders - and find who is similar to those users

	-Look at the earliest 10 posts from users 
	
-Treat all number words as a single "word"? Or dates?

-Remove Bots from the dataset (Chenhao)
